🏦 CLI-Based Online Banking System in Python:

This is a simple command-line banking system built in Python using file handling and dictionaries for managing users, logins, and banking operations.

It allows users to:

-Create accounts

-Log in and log out

-Deposit and withdraw funds

-Check balances

-Change passwords

-Delete accounts

All data is persistently stored in .txt files (accounts.txt, bank.txt, login.txt), making the application data-safe across multiple runs.

🚀 Features
✅ User Sign-Up and Login

✅ Password Validation

✅ Account Balance Management

✅ Login Session Tracking

✅ Data Persistence using Files

✅ Basic Error Handling

✅ Command-Line Interface (CLI)

📁 File Structure
